# Module 1 : Hello Hackers

# i) introduction to commands
Includes a basic introdution to commands used in linux <br>
Learned to invoke my first command <br>
Also, commands in linux are case sensitive <br>
The command `whoami` prints the name of the user <br>
I invoked the `hello` command to the terminal which gave me a flag(like a key) which was to be entered on pwn.college

# Intro to Arguements
An arguement is the additional data passed to the command<br>
When i type a line of text, the system internally breaks it into the command and the arugement<br>
The `echo` command prints the arguement passed to it. For example, `echo college' outputs "college"<br>
In short, it echoes all of it's arguements back to the terminal<br>
I also executed the hello command
